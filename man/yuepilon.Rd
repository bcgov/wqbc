\description{
Hydrometric data are collected and compiled by Water Survey of
Canada's eight regional offices. The information is housed in
two centrally-managed databases: HYDEX and HYDAT.
}
\details{
HYDAT is a relational database that contains the actual computed
data for the stations listed in HYDEX. These data include: daily and
monthly means of flow, water levels and sediment concentrations
(for sediment sites). For some sites, peaks and extremes are also
recorded.

WSC now offers hydrometric data and station information in a single
downloadable file, either in Microsoft Access Database format or in
SQLite format, updated on a quarterly basis.

This database was used to derive the yuepilon dataset, which is a
table of annual mean river flows for four sites: 02FB007, 02KB001,
02EA005 and 02GA010.
