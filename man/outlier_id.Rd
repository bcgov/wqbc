\title{Identify Outliers In Water Quality Data}
\usage{
outlier_id(x, by = NULL, mad_threshold = 10, ts_threshold = 6,
  max_cv = 1.29, messages = getOption("wqbc.messages", default = TRUE))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The data.frame to analyse.}

\item{by}{A character vector of the columns in x to perform the outlier detection by.}

\item{max_cv}{A number indicating the maximum permitted coefficient
of variation.}

\item{messages}{A flag indicating whether to print messages.}
}
\description{
Identifies outliers in water quality data.
}
\details{
The method is motivated by Hampels Mean Absolute Deviation approach for time series. It is a 
combination of two tecniques:
  1. remove large outliers when compared to the MAD of the whole time series
  2. 
    a. fit a reasonably flexible time series model to identify 
       trend in the data using a robust regression approach by iteratively reweighting
    b. assign zero weight to observations with very large residuals from the robust fit
    c. repeat this procedure until all outliers have been identified.

\examples{
x <- standardize_wqdata(wqbc::dummy)
outlier_removal(x, by = "Variable", messages = TRUE)
